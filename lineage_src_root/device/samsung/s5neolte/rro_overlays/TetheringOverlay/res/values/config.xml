         The new trafficController design is based on per-cgroup eBPF filter as well as xt_bpf netfilter module inside the kernel.
         However, support for per-cgroup eBPF is available on only on kernels >=4.9 . Disable BPF offloading support completely
         as without proper per-cgroup eBPF, the stats returns errors continuously.
